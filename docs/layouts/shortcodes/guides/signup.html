<p>The first step to deploying anything on Platform.sh is, of course, to sign up for an account. You will first need to visit the <a href="https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup">Platform.sh accounts</a> page and fill out your information to set up your trial account. If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose one of these options, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.</p>
